## CredHub Service Broker ##

This repo contains the documentation for the CredHub Service Broker service tile.

This product was formerly known as CredHub Service Broker for PCF.

The `main` branch is the only published branch. This branch is protected.

This documentation publishes to the staging site at https://docs-staging.vmware.com/en/CredHub-Service-Broker/index.html and to the production site at https://docs.vmware.com/en/CredHub-Service-Broker/index.html.

## Contributing to Documentation

If there is some documentation to add for an unreleased patch version, then create a branch off of the **live** branch
you intend to modify and create a pull request against that branch.
After the version that change is targeting is released, the pull request can be merged and will be live
the next time a documentation deployment occurs.

If the documentation is meant to be target several released versions,
then you will need to:
+ create a pull request for each individual minor version
+ or ask the technical writer to cherry-pick to particular branches/versions.

For instructions on how to create a pull request on a branch and instructions on how to create a
pull request using a fork, see
[Creating a PR](https://docs-wiki.sc2-04-pcf1-apps.oc.vmware.com/wiki/external/create-pr.html)
in the documentation team wiki.


## Publishing Docs

- [docworks](https://docworks.vmware.com/) is the main tool for managing docs used by writers.
- [docsdash](https://docsdash.vmware.com/) is a deployment UI which manages the promotion from
staging to pre-prod to production. The process below describes how to upload our docs to staging,
replacing the publication with the same version.

### Prepare Markdown Files
- Markdown files live in this repo.
- Images should live in an `images` directory at the same level and linked with a relative link.
- Each page requires an entry in [config/toc.md](config/toc.md) for the table of contents.
- Variables live in [config/template_variables.yml](config/template_variables.yml).

### In Docsdash

1. Wait about 1 minute for processing to complete after uploading.
2. Go to https://docsdash.vmware.com/deployment-stage

   There should be an entry with a blue link which says `Documentation` and points to staging.

### Promoting to Pre-Prod and Prod

## Troubleshooting Markdown

| Problem | List displays as a paragraph |
|---------|-----------|
| Symptom:| Bulleted or numbered lists look fine on GitHub but display as a single paragraph in HTML.|
| Solution: | Add a blank line after the stem sentence and before the first item in the list.|

| Problem | List numbering is broken: every item is `1.` |
|---------|-----------|
| Symptom:| Each numbered item in a list is a `1.` instead of `1.`, `2.`, `3.`, etc|
| Solution: | Try removing any blank newlines within each step.|

| Problem | Code boxes not showing |
|---------|-----------|
| Symptom:| VMware publishing system doesn't accept code tags after the three back ticks.|
| Solution: | Make sure you're not using `shell` or `bash` or `console` or `yaml` after back ticks.|
