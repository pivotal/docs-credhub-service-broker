title: CredHub Service Broker for PCF
owner: CredHub
---

The CredHub Service Broker for PCF allows apps running on Pivotal Application 
Service (PAS) to access secure credentials in CredHub. 

Apps can use these credentials to authenticate with services not on PAS. 
These may include services running within PCF such as Spring Cloud Services for PCF or services external to PCF.

The CredHub Service Broker for PCF uses secure service instance credentials
to prevent credential exposure in the app environment.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

The CredHub Service Broker for PCF registers a service broker with PCF and exposes 
its service plans on the Marketplace. 
Developers can then create service instances using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command
Line Interface (cf CLI) and bind them to their apps.

Creating a Credhub Service Broker instance and binding it to an app creates a credential 
in CredHub and provides the reference to that credential in the app environment. 
This allows developers to deploy apps that can securely access credentials for 
services that are not running on PAS.

## <a id='features'></a>Key Features
