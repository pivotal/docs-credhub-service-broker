This topic describes how to use CredHub Service Broker.

## <a id='create'></a> Create and Bind a Service Instance

Creating a CredHub Service Broker instance and binding it to an app creates a credential in CredHub
and provides the reference to that credential in the app environment.
This allows developers to deploy apps that can securely access credentials for services that are not
running on VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs).

To create a service instance of the CredHub Service Broker and bind it to your app:

1. Create a CredHub Service Broker service instance by running:

   ```console
   cf create-service credhub default SERVICE-INSTANCE \
   -c '{"CREDENTIAL-NAME":"CREDENTIAL-VALUE"}'
   ```

   Where:

   - `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is a name for your new service instance.
   - `CREDENTIAL-NAME` is the name for the credential you want to provide to services that are not
     running on TAS for VMs.
   - `CREDENTIAL-VALUE` is the value of the credential.

   > **Note** You can provide multiple credentials as a JSON list.
   > This JSON list has a maximum size of 64&nbsp;KB. For example,
   > `{"MY\_CREDHUB\_CRED": "1234", "MY\_CREDHUB\_CRED2": "5678"}`.

   For example:

   ```console
   $ cf create-service credhub default my-credhub-instance \
   -c '{"name":"MY\_CREDHUB\_CRED","value":"ABCDEFGHIJK123456789"}'
   ```

2. Ensure that your app is written to use the credential that was provided through the service
   creation. `VCAP_SERVICES` is an environment variable that exists in every container.

   Access the `credhub` JSON object within `VCAP_SERVICES` to discover the credentials.
   For example, in Ruby you access this JSON object with `ENV['VCAP_SERVICES']['credhub']`.

   If you need to edit your app code, you must re-push the app before continuing.

3. Bind the CredHub Service Broker service instance to your app by running:

   ```console
   cf bind-service APP-NAME SERVICE-INSTANCE
   ```

4. Restart your app by running:

   ```console
   cf restart APP-NAME
   ```

5. Your app now has access to the credential created earlier. Verify that your credential is in the
   app environment by running the following command and locate the CredHub reference under
   `VCAP_SERVICES` in the output:

   ```console
   cf env APP-NAME
   ```

   For example:

   ```console
   $ cf env my-app
   Getting env variables for app my-app in org example / space example as admin...
   OK
   System-Provided:
   {
   "VCAP\_SERVICES": {
   "credhub": [
    {
     "binding\_name": null,
     "credentials": {
      "credhub-ref": "/credhub-service-broker/credhub/ac517e09-2f5e-475a-bf87-ca4275faa536/credentials"
     },
     "instance\_name": "credhub",
     "label": "credhub",
     "name": "credhub",
     "plan": "default",
     "provider": null,
     "syslog\_drain\_url": null,
     "tags": [
      "credhub"
     ],
     "volume\_mounts": []
    }
   ]
   }
   }
   ```

## <a id='update'></a> Update Credentials

To update the credentials in a CredHub Service Broker service instance:

1. Create a CredHub Service Broker service instance by running:

   ```console
   cf update-service SERVICE-INSTANCE \
   -c '{"CREDENTIAL-NAME":"CREDENTIAL-VALUE"}'
   ```

   Where:

   - `SERVICE-INSTANCE` is the name of your existing CredHub Service Broker service instance.
   - `CREDENTIAL-NAME` is the name for the updated credential you want to provide to services that
     are not running on TAS for VMs.
   - `CREDENTIAL-VALUE` is the value of the credential.

   > **Note** You can update multiple credentials as a JSON list.
   > For example, `{"MY\_CREDHUB\_CRED": "1234", "MY\_CREDHUB\_CRED2": "5678"}`.

   For example:

   ```console
   $ cf update-service SERVICE-INSTANCE \
   -c '{"name":"MY\_CREDHUB\_CRED","value":"ABCDEFGHIJK123456789"}'
   ```

2. Restart your app by running:

   ```console
   cf restart APP-NAME
   ```
