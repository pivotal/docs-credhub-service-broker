This topic describes how to install and configure CredHub Service Broker.

##<a id='prereq'></a> Prerequisites

To install and configure the CredHub Service Broker, you must have CredHub instances available
in your VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) deployment.

To confirm the number of CredHub instances available, perform the following actions:

1. Click the **TAS for VMs** tile in the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Select the **Resource Config** tab.

1. Locate the **CredHub** job and verify that the number of instances is set to at least `1`.

    The number of instances that you need depends on both the version of TAS for VMs
    and whether or not you want high availability:
    <table class="nice">
	<th>In TAS for VMs version…</th>
	<th>For high availability, set to…</th>
	<th>Default value is…</th>
	<tr>
		<td>2.7 and earlier</td>
		<td><code>2</code> or more</td>
		<td><code>0</code></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2.8 and later</td>
		<td><code>3</code> or more</td>
		<td><code>2</code></td>
	</tr>
  </table>
